#Title
Aim Trainer

## Repository
https://github.com/Shrimmp/Final-Project/tree/main

## Description
I plan to create a sort of aim training game where objects will move across the screen in random places
and when clicked on, they will disappear and add a number of points to a total score

## Features
- Targets
The targets will spawn randomly once the others present in the scene disappear. At most there will 
be 2 on screen at a time.

- In app mouse sensitivity
I plan to learn how to make users change mouse sensitivity within the game using multipliers.

- Total Score
To promote replayability, I will keep a running score from the player that will display after the alotted
time is completed. Players will want to beat their previous score, making them come back.

## Challenges
- I need to learn how to take user input from a mouse within a game.
- I need to learn how to allow users to customize mouse sensitivity within the game.
- I need to learn (or brush up on) how to keep a running score from the player and keep data locally on a system
to keep track of high scores.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally I would like to create a fully functional game where players can customize mouse sensitivity, 
play to beat previous high scores, and get better at fps games through my program.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essential for this project is a working program that keeps a running score when targets are
hit and ends after a timer of 1-2 minutes is complete. The mouse sensitivity and high score data collection
is not required for the program to be complete but would be nice QOL changes.

## Milestones

- Week 1
1. Finish base programming of targets spawning in at random points. Add mouse input to hit targets
2. Add timer to program. Hopefully have timer show on screen. 

- Week 2
1. Have mouse sensitivity changer (either buttons or a slider or input value)
2. Have data storage system to have a high score regardless of closing application

- Week 3 (Final)
1. Finishing touches/ QOL changes
2. maybe let players change target color from default (white) by hitting a button? (Not required but nice QOL change)
