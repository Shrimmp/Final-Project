## Description
Flicky Aim Trainer is a short game that is meant to improve your FPS gaming skills through continuous use,
as you gain more comfortability in your use of the mouse, the better you will become. 
Specifically for the excercise shown here, it is meant to help with the users "micro adjustments", making
it easier to move your mouse a short distance to hit your target.

In the future, I could make this into a first person experience to further bridge the connection with FPS gamers. 
I also want to make an online leaderboard, were the users high scores are compiled and encourages players to 
not only beat their score but to also beat that of other players worldwide. As I put in my proposal document, I wanted
to make a ui element that pops up before the game starts where the user can decide on different elements, such
as the background color, target color, and number of targets at a time. In the ui element, I could also add an option to change
the amount of time in a round, or a crosshair to appear on screen rather than the user's mouse cursor.
