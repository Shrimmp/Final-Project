## Description
Flicky Aim Trainer is a short game that is meant to improve your FPS gaming skills through continuous use,
as you gain more comfortability in your use of the mouse, the better you will become. 
Specifically for the excercise shown here, it is meant to help with the users "micro adjustments", making
it easier to move your mouse a short distance to hit your target.
